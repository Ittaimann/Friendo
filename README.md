# Friendo
A cute little I don't know yet for programming with non-programmer friendos.

## goals
Dude I don't know why are you even asking me

## getting started

First things first [install visual studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
Its a free **INDUSTRY** grade c++ development environment and has most 
of what we need built in. It can be very intimmidating but don't worry you can 
disregarda a lot. if its too large to deal with or runs slow come to me and we will figure out alternatives.
Its not a huge issue, but we need some of it.

Next find the source folder in you user folder (the folder in you pc thats your username), if its not there don't worry just make one. We will be putting the project
and the next download in this folder.

Next is [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and get the development libraries for windows
Sdl2 is essentially a big library for games an multimedia programming. Its used in one degree or another in 
most games on pc (if youve ever seen sdl2.dll then the game is using it).

Then you going to want to pull this repository. Open visual studio and on the right there should be a 
"clone or check out code box" click that and supply the link with "https://github.com/Ittaimann/Friendo.git"
and put where you want the repository to be. I suggest putting this in the source folder in you home directory, if that doesn't exist make a folder 
called repos in you documents folder and put friendo there.I will probably create a better explanation of git in its own place
cause its uber duper imporant.

next is follow this [tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php). This should
help you get setup, just adjust all the paths for where sdl is on your machine and if hes using x86 use the x64 version instead.
Also when you are setting up the property pages change the configuration to all and the platform to x64. This is pretty much what I'm building off currently to be honest and its seems like the series is very good. 
I won't be doing everything it does but it goes pretty far tbh.

Finally if everything was done correctly you should be able to run the code by clicking local Windows debugger or hitting f5.
All you should see is the hello world pop up, unless I've done more work.
I'd suggest going through the lazyfoo tutorials but it might not be necessary.

also at any of these step ***ASK ME FOR HELP IF YOU NEED IT*** 

## extended goals for this???
	- have fun
	- teach programming
	- teach git
	- make game
	- implement luajit/luabind so life is easier.
	- implement dear imgui so there is editor.
	- uh yell.
